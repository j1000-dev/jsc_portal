    thank you for this outreach program and for the excellent coaching…”",
    
    'Britannia Elementary' => "“…most of our students come from low income 
    families and over half of our students are First Nations….Our 
    running teams have doubled in size since JOS began working in our community – 
    this is quite a feat given the early morning practice schedule!”",

    'Thunderbird Elementary' => "“We are one of a few schools with the largest 
    population of First Nations students in Vancouver, and many of our 
    families are refugees from war-torn nations…Not only have 
    your coaches brought professional instruction to our school, 
    they have been amazing mentors for our students.”",

    'Graham Bruce Elementary' => "“I sincerely hope

    children.This outstanding coaching has been offered to the students 
    at no cost and they have really enjoyed and been aware of the 
    quality of coaching they are receiving.”",

    at this critical stage in their growth and development.”",

    'MacCorkindale Elementary' => "“…not only were your coaches able to motivate 
    students to work on their skills,but their positive rapport made the 
    students enjoy the sport even more……would not have a team without the Jerome Outreach Society.”",

    'Windsor Elementary (student)' => "“Without the help of the SFU coaches, Ms. Jackson probably 
    would’ve combusted due to so much pressure…. It also makes me feel very happy to find one 
    of my best friends, Katrina Leo, so happy to play basketball with such professionals. 
    She is one of our best players and I think she has a chance to play University basketball 
    one day, and it’s exciting to think that it all started with her being coached by your program.”",

    'Cameron Elementary' => "“Our school cannot provide the extent, and quality of coaching 
    that is provided by the exceptional JOS professional coaches. I feel the

    athletic experiences.”",

    JOS caliber is something our school could not afford to provide.”",

    'Ecole Inman Elementary' => "“JOS has provided us with support through 
    excellent coaches and organizations of practices over the past three years……Our

    training and experiences had it not been for the JOS”",
    
    'Vancouver Technical Secondary' => "“Vancouver Technical Secondary is an Inner City school 
    with a number of students who come from low-income households….This is why the
